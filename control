Description: X.Org X server - core server
 The X.Org X server is an X server for several architectures and operating
 systems, which is derived from the XFree86 4.x series of X servers.
 .
 The X.Org server supports most modern graphics hardware from most vendors,
 and supersedes all XFree86 X servers.
 .
 The X.Org server either needs fonts installed on the local host, or needs to
 know of a remote hosts that provides font services (with xfs, for instance).
 The former means that fonts packages are mandatory. The latter means that
 font packages may be gratuitous. To err on the side of caution, install at
 least the xfonts-base, xfonts-100dpi or xfonts-75dpi, and xfonts-scalable
 packages.
 .

Description: X.Org X server - development files
 This package provides development files for the X.Org ('Xorg') X server.
 This is not quite the same as the DDK (Driver Development Kit) from the
 XFree86 4.x and X.Org 6.7, 6.8 and 6.9 series of servers; it provides
 headers and a pkg-config file for drivers using autotools to build
 against.
 .
 Unless you are developing or building a driver, you probably want
 xserver-xorg and/or xserver-xorg-core instead.

#Package: xdmx
#Architecture: any
#Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
#Description: distributed multihead X server
# Xdmx is a proxy X server that uses one or more other X servers as its
# display device(s). It provides multi-head X functionality for displays that
# might be located on different machines. Xdmx functions as a front-end X server
# that acts as a proxy to a set of back-end X servers. All of the visible
# rendering is passed to the back-end X servers. Clients connect to the Xdmx
# front-end, and everything appears as it would in a regular multi-head
# configuration. If Xinerama is enabled (e.g., with +xinerama on the command
# line), the clients see a single large screen.

Package: xnest
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Nested X server
 Xnest is a nested X server that simply relays all its requests to another
 X server, where it runs as a client.  This means that it appears as another
 window in your current X session.  Xnest relies upon its parent X server
 for font services.
 .
 Use of the Xephyr X server instead of Xnest is recommended.

Package: xvfb
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Recommends: xbase-clients, xfonts-base
Description: Virtual Framebuffer 'fake' X server
 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program.

Package: xserver-xephyr
Architecture: any

Description: nested X server
 Xephyr is an X server that can be run inside another X server,
 much like xnest. It is based on the kdrive X server, and as a
 result it supports newer extensions than Xnest, including render and
 composite.
