    Don't break grab and focus state for a window when redirecting it.
    
    Composite uses an unmap/map cycle to trigger backing pixmap allocation
    and cliprect recomputation when a window is redirected or unredirected.
    To avoid protocol visible side effects, map and unmap events are
    disabled temporarily.  However, when a window is unmapped it is also
    removed from grabs and loses focus, but these state changes are not
    disabled.
    
    This change supresses the unmap side effects during the composite
    unmap/map cycle and fixes this bug:
    
      http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=488264
    
    where compiz would cause gnome-screensaver to lose its grab when
    compiz unredirects the fullscreen lock window.
