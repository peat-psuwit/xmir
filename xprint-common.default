# If you do not want Xprint to automatically start, then set START_XPRINT=0
# By default, START_XPRINT=1, enabling Xprt, the Xprint server, to be started.

# Note that this can be more effectively done by removing the start-up symlinks
# to /etc/init.d/xprint, e.g.
# 	rm /etc/rc[1-6].d/*xprint*

# If you always want Xprint to run, you may safely remove this file.
