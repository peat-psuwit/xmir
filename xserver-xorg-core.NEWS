xorg-server (2:1.17.2-4) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  The Xorg server is no longer setuid root by default.  This change reduces the
  risk of privilege escalation due to X server bugs, but has some side effects:

  * it relies on logind and libpam-systemd
  * it relies on a kernel video driver (so the userspace component doesn't
    touch the hardware directly)
  * it needs X to run on the virtual console (VT) it was started from

  On systems where those are not available, the new xserver-xorg-legacy package
  is needed to allow X to run with elevated privileges.  See the
  Xwrapper.config(5) manual page for configuration details.
